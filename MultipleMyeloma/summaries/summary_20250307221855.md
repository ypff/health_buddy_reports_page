# Multiple Myeloma: Your Guide to Key Updates & Actionable Insights for 2025

**Executive Summary:** Groundbreaking advances in multiple myeloma (MM) are transforming treatment, leading to improved outcomes and potentially longer survival. New drugs, improved diagnostic tools, and better side effect management offer new hope. This guide provides clear, actionable information for patients and their families to navigate these advancements.

**Treatment Breakthroughs: New Options, Clear Actions**

*   **New FDA-Approved Drug: Elrexfio (Elranatamab).** This BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody, given as a subcutaneous injection, received FDA approval in August 2023 for patients with relapsed/refractory MM who have already tried at least four prior treatments, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. [See Pfizer's Elrexfio Information](https://www.pfizer.com/products/product-detail/elrexfio).  *Action: If you've had multiple lines of therapy, talk to your doctor about Elranatamab. It is available only through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program because of the risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), requiring close monitoring. The EMA has also recommended conditional marketing authorization for Elrexfio in the EU [[17]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblry2RV1DgPhZ0j8luuM3jKpJkVIgZIpExKa-c5qLy4ze_vY5_9ruoaQ9wWbGCDM-bZ4s5S-mL_Egv8Y0vpPzCdH7AQ6dxe88MrpkP_0mrxeDJlHm0-6JbqT3j-_wMUpQsJJdFODuXxWS_WiT8YI3pOSP9CDVl_vPGCsXMtWSCpQ2QCJ97RmxCOOKfMSsYoUWqke9PFvldHqrmuI0sRI9xg==).*

*   **D-VRd as Preferred First-Line Treatment:** Daratumumab + Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (D-VRd) has moved to a preferred regimen as a strong first-line treatment, according to the NCCN guidelines, for *newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible* patients, often followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT).  [Check the most recent NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma](https://www.nccn.org/guidelines/guidelines-detail?category=1&id=1459).  *Action: If you are newly diagnosed and transplant-eligible, ask your doctor whether D-VRd is right for you. Also, for transplant-ineligible patients, Isatuximab-irfc (Sarclisa) when combined with standard-of-care VRd became the first anti-CD38 therapy to show a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression. [[7]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrzYO4OZ36DcFPJTdGD4nOhdMgvAO2x1HupbQ_GOB4KlC-opfVZt892jN8qnC_Oj7LtPzZuOeAmc9pirL4qYeAjduwACDTM6h7zAul7xWC8XY8g26PaAPA1aV7KVFmtiRImPQA7qa-bH4OJ3yyLdg3yCUPE5GFv9isPLZgrMWujs_9Y-Bi7IrRLP9zXZ97RBupn_gtP0iXH4fyKHqW_IbH0VoX2yH1yGPal9KzpRzTztrF8oY7fI=)*
    *   **Update:** The FDA approved an injectable form of daratumumab with hyaluronidase (Darzalex Faspro) given with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for transplant-eligible patients. Isatuximab (Sarclisa) was approved when given with the same three drugs for transplant-ineligible patients.

*   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** CAR T-cell therapies like idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel show promise. In early 2024, both products were approved for earlier lines of therapy. [[6]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrx-DHUEeXxofYOjD5zuzQ9CWlLNzY3ocfgF6hQuXDwOZdPj10ZxVtn3svn6gWwjkuRwaPwDUnuIyZoVLQZDb2AEEbRm9V6Guy_sVG4rSz_MJf2aalratZcve21r0UvsvKtvdmTtqgPaLxGoYZIkjj2ZZGVU16iuJer4m8eNGNSXuSIlu4-jkJgrY8mi0JB6-B212F8EiWdC4N-jifeufoqz5vSSghH8N3OiHdKdi5ycRRGaqm7PgHscS6ohOtdQ_tShxLzjV_D8lcGYiBGa9Pby5Qqe5A_OOdkv6IEjbAVfbQ==) *Action:* Discuss with your oncologist if CAR T-cell therapy is an option for you and get early referrals to specialized centers to prevent delays [[22]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblryGZrchkDlEH3N6nm3J9hk2O4xPTJG-KbHr4cwxEkaTHwI7U4enUMkXL6vw7X_YvsrxGdUKbIx8rhweqaUktKTMUHMmQzZJw7hAlOdGJU3zZppp-zaJBoKXjd7KH-OvJWpO8Ti48lsgJ7xtqD8PPnnoq5bzg0yuwEQEqDoEQ-E3O4oJMOYcmug-En62Ix5KBxgHctEluSABH8hgYKKRZIZB4k06E5Pw1aXpVE343w==). Two approved CAR T-cell therapies are idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, Abecma) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel, Carvykti).
*   **Clinical Trial Participation:** Phase 3 trials are testing new drug combinations with standard treatments for newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible patients. *Action: Explore clinical trial options with your oncologist. Resources include clinicaltrials.gov, MMRF Trial Finder ([https://www.themmrf.org/](https://www.themmrf.org/)), and IMF Clinical Trial Search ([https://www.myeloma.org/](https://www.myeloma.org/)). Discuss suitability with your doctor.* Note that the AMN008 trial is scheduled to launch at sites in Singapore, South Korea, and Australia, with the first patient expected to be enrolled in early 2025 [[3]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblryTkOs7ansAtdvZaCc31Wg2Z5Ddmr14wjAGACaKhugvfLIGTmFob4bQ9w1CgNpsd_hu4jH1fhNP8m8EkPPvYM4HFBfgHSg3a_k4aqiBmnjmkJw0Rf_eJM3IjO6RUGqVo_Wk59PwnJzx)

**Smarter Diagnostics: Earlier Detection, Better Monitoring**

*   **MRD Testing: A Key Indicator.** Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing (using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and flow cytometry) is increasingly important to detect any remaining myeloma cells after treatment. Achieving MRD negativity often indicates a deeper remission and potentially longer progression-free survival [[11]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblryRR-sKNQCTcQHQcysKgiqOkCybTfiGxFpJ3HeT1jCoiBh9le0kLsbZ-ukRzaEsliMRzlaYJkI9GtbvgsVL62ovRnkReTuwO88AdnVLMnCbXYF6brDIRm_0D1Ln3G_NLjMDvLLpOoip8lFwgegS-qIqzp9yavAiy_6e_NC1LWwYXR_GfLnGNin7HpvxT3Uf1y1wPdItXUi3rhAUpGWJdjOTzFlN5xWh6B21XH8U8U8EboygeloBHBgF8hjI_qTfOz_LsA==). *Action: Discuss MRD testing with your doctor to assess the depth of your remission and guide future treatment decisions.*
*   **Advanced Imaging:** Improved PET/CT and MRI scans offer enhanced MM diagnosis and monitoring [[29]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrzjscYyfPRSFHWmXkpKD49xVnRcqwrh2izxd8LVsZUuQhb83lMxirscri71OW6HvtAYo7Xc4ZS7uR-Ote_fXgQouNJPud-tbOKjUksHjdHnxUw7fuA4vGtFcdE8zzWqW7Wgh1OD5pqUKyhzSpLPclcKB2wErK7Jl9AkWLOgWw==). Low-dose whole-body CT scans are increasingly used for screening *high-risk individuals*, such as those with MGUS, smoldering myeloma, or a family history of blood cancers [[39]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrylLXQRhlBbPnRjkUexvB7pCeSm-W1tNBQBZl-zGbvWJHt6MwMVfYDvGtEmR56IEyW6X7udcgMjzur6gDn_s1bZqUDAL3n9KyGjE22MXrxGfHgcMI5fsT2J_1P65ZRlrk4lBr0vkht0rgg=). *Action: Ask your doctor about the role of advanced imaging in monitoring your disease, especially if you are considered high-risk.*

**Improved Patient Support: Better Quality of Life**

*   **Proactive Side Effect Management:** Newer treatments can have side effects like peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, increased risk of infections [[24]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrx4hSHDgrI8TQXPaXukE3MyU2UDwrBD8MA7OGTIVV4o7gg1xJcVTMAezZW1qywolX4HIUgn61Qo_9c5u-vAehGSyRkeqWuChGBqaKVf5qIjW_30D4VRAwXJYRKD-ssSYsb-SVZy8XvBAf_UKz6JjazgBaLTQf2kg5c55-8OQJ-xf6e-caZQqFyNS4LoOxx6jx5qyHp5zfXD4xhQqOhddRI) and bone pain. *Action: Work closely with your healthcare team to proactively manage these side effects through pain medication, physical therapy, and infection prevention strategies. Also, studies suggest that lower doses of dexamethasone may be just as effective, with fewer side effects.* [[10]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblryShmxCYkTc__o5tomi54JEGjix4bnM7iKkW7TmklKrPNmsBklwzFbJStKv5g5Ya7jVE2oYQ5dSjCo_iAstqqHDYcpMOJOzAGplun3Gj0NBabDkqtbxqjQ7KBBZgQD_a_FXnE-XrDofIjfD6YFP1HuQcM8cbIF_tpipuJd41cdOboz6BV9I7g3kYb0g3JRQdlxrU9m64GX7)
*   **Valuable Resources:** Organizations like the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) [https://www.myeloma.org/], the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) [https://www.myeloma.org/], and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) [https://www.lls.org/] offer vital education, financial aid, and support.
*   **Integrative Therapies:** Don't underestimate the importance of exercise, good nutrition, and psychological support [[15]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrw9afUWz2OIrNv79qFy4zO56VZChvwXascgs6Kqsv1XvEuUY0VVfnuOuGkRXWZP5v3dYEXQeuV66LTx949MnssGqSrfjahJCwhkCzXsagHZ_JTuB0L7FcZTzTSdZzk6-BQs30KjTRcoJ8QqaaAwartOFB7fWyLllHGAxkL9hXJCkn6T38XoKMX5yKxLX6Bv3m4s_NSh4Gu6ye6YeQ==). *Action: Connect with patient advocacy groups and explore integrative therapies to improve your overall well-being.*

**Key Clinical Trials to Watch in 2025:**

Focus on trials evaluating novel combinations of bispecific antibodies [[26]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrwhduo3NIx0xosste1VboZSbdgJvV1MJmZ0pvhPfhbdRVN_KCSjVcWlmwrvg5SfeRLhac11BnHOb3cSd8vm4Ow2ydweb9xFy4JKUIjTqnPGGRNMJwmSjDue543ubyWVCChg1RNH0zUDRAasth8iMlUlXQYNo8FnYEnIf0ChnzWDqdiPESjsrME_rklMEz4yhNpHBla3_suc4y6s85Hj6UW2lTIbYEcknrIaqzA), studies optimizing CAR T-cell therapy and expanding its use to earlier lines of therapy [[6]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrx-DHUEeXxofYOjD5zuzQ9CWlLNzY3ocfgF6hQuXDwOZdPj10ZxVtn3svn6gWwjkuRwaPwDUnuIyZoVLQZDb2AEEbRm9V6Guy_sVG4rSz_MJf2aalratZcve21r0UvsvKtvdmTtqgPaLxGoYZIkjj2ZZGVU16iuJer4m8eNGNSXuSIlu4-jkJgrY8mi0JB6-B212F8EiWdC4N-jifeufoqz5vSSghH8N3OiHdKdi5ycRRGaqm7PgHscS6ohOtdQ_tShxLzjV_D8lcGYiBGa9Pby5Qqe5A_OOdkv6IEjbAVfbQ==), and research into new targets and antibody-drug conjugates [[31]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrwPUmJPuutHZ1IxeBk8Eaqe6AVwWS9UvF19BlnZSI1wjxUeXSXABmyfy_WlOqyr29hZeLkVN7HTNvAP4zaKo1Dabd5KOCwLnZ7AOBhqyIgL6D9Tw3FbJ4JQTQ8Cceuzc0HuCAoing==). *Action: Stay informed about trial results from medical journals and conference proceedings (ASH, ASCO, EHA). A Phase Ib/II trial shows that Talvey plus Tecvayli has promising activity but raises infection concerns.*[[24]](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AQXblrx4hSHDgrI8TQXPaXukE3MyU2UDwrBD8MA7OGTIVV4o7gg1xJcVTMAezZW1qywolX4HIUgn61Qo_9c5u-vAehGSyRkeqWuChGBqaKVf5qIjW_30D4VRAwXJYRKD-ssSYsb-SVZy8XvBAf_UKz6JjazgBaLTQf2kg5c55-8OQJ-xf6e-caZQqFyNS4LoOxx6jx5qyHp5zfXD4xhQqOhddRI)

# Multiple Myeloma: Key Updates for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary highlights essential information about Multiple Myeloma, including new treatments, disease management, and support resources. We focus on actionable information to help patients and their families navigate their journey.

## 1. Treatment Advancements

*   **Quadruplet Regimens: A New Standard:** The quadruplet regimen, Daratumumab plus Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone (Dara-VRd), is now a standard treatment, particularly for transplant-eligible patients, based on studies like the phase 3 GRIFFIN trial. This regimen is FDA approved. Typically, induction therapy with Dara-VRd may last for approximately 4-6 cycles, followed by stem cell transplantation and then maintenance therapy. However, the exact duration is personalized based on individual patient factors and response to treatment. Key side effects include infusion reactions (daratumumab) and neuropathy, fatigue, and low blood counts (cytopenias) (VRd). Side effects are typically manageable with supportive care such as premedication for infusion reactions, dose adjustments for neuropathy, and growth factors or transfusions for low blood counts. Discuss specific management strategies with your doctor. **Track:** Monitor and track any side effects, response to treatment (M-protein levels). **Action:** Report any new or worsening side effects immediately to your care team.

*   **Daratumumab Combinations:** The phase 3 MAIA trial showed that adding daratumumab to Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (Dara-Rd) significantly improves outcomes for transplant-ineligible, newly diagnosed patients. Dara-Rd is FDA approved as a first-line treatment for this group. **Track:** Monitor disease progression (myeloma getting worse or coming back). **Action:** Discuss with your doctor if Dara-Rd is appropriate for your situation.

*   **Bispecific Antibodies (Relapsed/Refractory):** For patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (when myeloma comes back after treatment or does not respond to initial treatments) after several prior treatments, bispecific antibodies like Teclistamab (Tecvayliâ„¢), which targets BCMA, offer a new approach. It's given as an injection and can cause Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a potentially serious side effect requiring initial hospitalization for monitoring, and neurotoxicity (ICANS). Initial hospitalization for monitoring typically lasts around 7-14 days, but this can vary depending on individual circumstances and hospital protocols. In the 2025 landscape, other approved bispecific antibodies include Elranatamab. Be aware of CRS symptoms, which can include fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness, rapid heartbeat, and fatigue. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. **Track:** Monitor and track side effects (especially CRS and neurotoxicity), disease response. **Action:** Be aware of CRS symptoms and immediately contact your care team. If you have relapsed or refractory myeloma after prior treatments, ask your doctor specifically about bispecific antibody therapies like Teclistamab and Elranatamab to see if they are appropriate for you.

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies (Relapsed/Refractory):** Following Daratumumab's success, other monoclonal antibodies like Elotuzumab and Isatuximab have been approved, expanding treatment options, particularly in relapsed/refractory settings and combined with other drugs. Common combinations include Elotuzumab + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone and Isatuximab + Pomalidomide + Dexamethasone. Monoclonal antibody combinations are often considered before or in situations where bispecific antibodies or CAR T-cell therapy might not be immediately appropriate or accessible, offering a less intensive but still effective treatment option. **Track:** Monitor treatment response and side effects. **Action:** Discuss with your doctor which monoclonal antibody-based regimen is right for you if you have relapsed or refractory disease.

*   **CDK7 Inhibitors:** Researchers are exploring CDK7 inhibitors. This approach is still investigational and not yet a standard treatment option. It's unclear if specific types of myeloma are more likely to be considered. **Track:** Monitor for updates on clinical trial results involving CDK7 inhibitors in multiple myeloma. **Action:** If interested in investigational therapies, ask your doctor about clinical trials for CDK7 inhibitors. When searching ClinicalTrials.gov, use search terms like 'CDK7 inhibitor' and 'multiple myeloma' to find relevant studies. You can also filter by 'recruiting' status and geographic location.

*   **Early Relapsed Myeloma and CAR T-cell Therapy:** BCMA-targeted therapies are also crucial at first relapse and beyond. In addition to bispecific antibodies, BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapies, such as idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti), are approved for relapsed/refractory myeloma. CAR T-cell therapy involves modifying a patient's own T cells to target myeloma cells. CAR T-cell therapy is generally reserved for patients who have had multiple prior lines of therapy and is a complex process that requires specialized centers and has specific eligibility criteria and potential long-term side effects beyond CRS and neurotoxicity. The typical timeline for CAR T-cell therapy, from evaluation to post-infusion monitoring, can take several weeks. Access to CAR T-cell therapy is currently available at certified treatment centers, which may require travel depending on your location. Discuss the availability and referral process with your specialist. **Track:** Monitor side effects (CRS, neurotoxicity), remission duration. **Action:** If you experience relapse, discuss the *potential* role of CAR T-cell therapy early in your relapse management plan with a myeloma specialist at a certified treatment center.

## 2. Smoldering Myeloma

*   **Interception Strategy:** For high-risk smoldering myeloma, an "interception" strategy is being investigated. The phase 3 AQUILA trial demonstrated that treatment with daratumumab can delay progression to active myeloma compared to observation. High-risk smoldering myeloma is assessed using various criteria, and while the '20/2/20' criteria (>=20% bone marrow plasma cells, serum M-protein >=2 g/dL, and involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio >=20) is a well-known example, risk stratification involves a comprehensive evaluation by a hematologist-oncologist considering multiple factors. These other factors can include specific genetic features of the myeloma cells (cytogenetics) and other biomarkers. Discuss your individual risk assessment with your specialist. **Track:** M-protein levels, plasma cell percentage. **Action:** If you have smoldering myeloma, ask your doctor to assess your risk level and discuss the potential benefits and risks of early treatment with daratumumab.

*   **Risk Stratification:** Before initiating treatment for smoldering myeloma, it's important to rule out active myeloma with PET/CT scans and whole-body MRI. **Action:** Ensure complete staging with appropriate imaging.

## 3. Importance of MRD Negativity

Achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity is a crucial goal because it indicates a deeper and more effective response to treatment, giving patients the best chance for long-term remission and improved outcomes. MRD negativity is strongly linked to longer remission duration and improved survival. MRD testing is typically performed on bone marrow samples because bone marrow is the primary site of myeloma cell growth, and bone marrow aspirates provide the most representative sample for assessing the depth of response within the disease environment. NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) and flow cytometry are highly sensitive tests performed on bone marrow samples to detect very small numbers of myeloma cells. **Track:** MRD status after treatment. **Action:** Ask your doctor about MRD testing (NGS or flow cytometry on bone marrow) after completing treatment.

## 4. Treatment Considerations

*   **Personalized Approach:** Maintenance therapy is now more personalized. Factors considered include risk stratification, MRD status, and the patient's ability to tolerate therapy. For patients with high-risk disease or who are not MRD negative, maintenance therapy might be longer or involve a combination of drugs, while for low-risk MRD negative patients, a less intensive approach may be considered. **Track:** Monitor side effects, disease markers. **Action:** Work with your doctor to develop a maintenance plan tailored to your individual needs.

*   **Neuropathy:** Be mindful of neuropathy risk with bortezomib-containing regimens, especially in older patients. If you are experiencing neuropathy, it's important to discuss management strategies with your healthcare team. These may include dose adjustments of medications, supportive medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin to alleviate nerve pain, or physical therapy to help maintain function. **Track:** Monitor neuropathy symptoms. **Action:** Report any numbness, tingling, or pain in your hands or feet to your doctor, nurse, or physician assistant promptly.

*   **Novel Therapies:** Stay updated on novel therapies in development, including CELMoDs like Iberdomide and Mezigdomide. CELMoDs are cereblon E3 ligase modulators, a newer class of drugs similar to lenalidomide and pomalidomide but potentially more potent. These drugs are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory myeloma and potentially earlier lines of therapy. They are being investigated for their potential to be more effective or overcome resistance to existing treatments like lenalidomide and pomalidomide. **Track:** Clinical trial availability. **Action:** Discuss potential clinical trial options with your doctor.

## 5. Symptoms and Diagnosis

Early myeloma symptoms can be vague. If you experience persistent back pain, bone pain, unexplained fatigue, anemia, recurrent infections, kidney problems, unexplained weight loss, or have elevated protein levels in blood or urine tests, discuss the possibility of multiple myeloma with your doctor, especially if you are over 65 or have other risk factors. **Action:** Consult your doctor about any unexplained symptoms.

## 6. Supportive Care and Resources

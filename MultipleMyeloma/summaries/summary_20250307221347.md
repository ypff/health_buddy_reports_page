## Multiple Myeloma: Your Action Plan (March 8, 2025)

**Your Guide to Living Well with Myeloma:** This summary provides important updates on myeloma treatment and management, empowering you to navigate your journey confidently.

**Key Updates & Actionable Insights:**

*   **New Treatment Option: Talquetamab (Talvey) Now Approved:** The FDA has approved Talquetamab (Talvey) for myeloma that has returned or is resistant to other treatments (specifically, after at least a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody). [Source: Talvey Prescribing Information](https://www.janssenlabels.com/package-insert/product-monograph/prescribing-information/TALVEY-pi.pdf)
    *   **Who it's for:** Adults with myeloma who have already tried at least three other treatments.
    *   **Why it matters:** Offers a new option when other treatments aren't working.
    *   **How it works:** Talquetamab is a bispecific antibody, given as a **subcutaneous injection** (under the skin), that helps your immune system attack myeloma cells.
    *   **What to watch for:**
        *   **Taste changes:** Report any unusual taste changes to your doctor.
        *   **Skin/nail issues:** Report any rashes, dry skin or nail changes.
        *   **Reduced blood cell counts:** Common and monitored with blood tests. Can increase risk of infection, fatigue, and bleeding.
        *   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS):** Potentially serious side effects from immune system activation, most common during initial doses and managed in a a hospital or clinic setting. Symptoms include fever, chills, and low blood pressure (CRS) or confusion, difficulty speaking, or seizures (ICANS).
    *   **How effective is it?** Clinical trials show promising response rates. Discuss specific results with your doctor.
    *   **Take Action:** Ask your doctor if Talquetamab is right for you, especially if other treatments haven't worked.

*   **Targeting MRD Negativity for Longer Remission:** Achieving Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, meaning no detectable myeloma cells after treatment, is a major goal.
    *   **What is MRD Negativity?** No myeloma cells can be found in your bone marrow using highly sensitive tests after treatment.
    *   **Why it's important:** Linked to longer remissions and better survival.
    *   **How it's tested:** Using advanced methods like next-generation sequencing (NGS) or flow cytometry. Cilta-cel can improve MRD negativity rates.

    *   **Important Note:** MRD negativity is a positive sign but not a guarantee of a cure. Regular follow-up is crucial.
    *   **Access to MRD Testing:** Discuss with your doctor if MRD testing is appropriate and available for you.
    *   **Take Action:** Talk to your doctor about MRD testing and how it might affect your treatment plan.

**Proactive Myeloma Management: Key Recommendations**

*   **Protect Your Bones:** Myeloma can weaken bones.
    *   **Action:** Discuss bone-strengthening medications like bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid) or denosumab (e.g., Xgeva or biosimilar Xbryk) with your healthcare team. [Source: National Cancer Institute - Multiple Myeloma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version](https://www.cancer.gov/types/myeloma/patient/myeloma-treatment-pdq) [Source: Biosimilar FDA-Approved for Myeloma Bone Strengthener Denosumab - HealthTree](https://healthtree.org/community/articles/biosimilar-fda-approved-for-myeloma-bone-strengthener-denosumab). Report any new bone pain immediately.
    *   **Bone-Strengthening Medications:** Discuss potential side effects of bisphosphonates and denosumab with your doctor. Maintain good dental hygiene while on bisphosphonates.
    *   **Support Bone Health Through Lifestyle:** Ensure you get enough calcium and vitamin D (as your doctor recommends), and do safe, weight-bearing exercises if your healthcare team advises.
*   **Prevent Infections:** Myeloma and its treatments weaken your immune system.
    *   **Prevent Infections:** Myeloma and its treatments make you more prone to infections like pneumonia, influenza, shingles, and COVID-19.
    *   **Action:** Get recommended vaccinations (influenza, pneumonia, COVID-19, etc.) after talking to your oncologist about the best timing and safety. [Source: Mayo Clinic - Multiple Myeloma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353383) Report any signs of infection (fever, cough, etc.) to your doctor right away. IVIG replacement may also be recommended. [Source: Infections With Bispecific Antibodies for Myeloma: Where Do We Stand Now?](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/OP.24.00019)
    *   **General Prevention:** Wash your hands regularly, avoid sick people, and follow food safety guidelines.
    *   **Vaccinations:** Discuss vaccinations with your doctor. Vaccines might be less effective when your immune system is weak, and booster doses may be needed.
*   **Consider Clinical Trials:** Access cutting-edge treatments through clinical trials.
    *   **Explore Clinical Trials:** Research studies testing new treatments. They can be an option at different stages of myeloma. Discuss with your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you.
    *   **Action:** Search ClinicalTrials.gov using keywords like 'multiple myeloma,' 'relapsed myeloma,' or specific treatments like 'CAR T-cell therapy' or 'bispecific antibody'. Filter by location. [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
    *   **Addressing Concerns:** Discuss any worries about clinical trials with your doctor or the research team. Participation is voluntary.
    *   **Additional Resources for Finding Trials:** International Myeloma Foundation ([https://www.myeloma.org/](https://www.myeloma.org/)) and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ([https://www.lls.org/](https://www.lls.org/)) can help you find trials.
*   **Take Care of Your Emotional Well-being:** A myeloma diagnosis can be tough emotionally.
    *   **Prioritize Emotional and Mental Well-being:** A myeloma diagnosis can bring a range of emotions.
    *   **Action:** Connect with your support network (family, friends), join a support group, or seek professional mental health support. The International Myeloma Foundation ([https://www.myeloma.org/](https://www.myeloma.org/)) and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ([https://www.lls.org/](https://www.lls.org/)) offer excellent resources.
    *   **Seek Support:** Lean on your support network, consider joining a myeloma support group (online or in-person), and don't hesitate to seek professional mental health support such as therapy or counseling.
    *   **Talk to Your Healthcare Team:** Don't hesitate to discuss your emotional concerns with your oncologist and healthcare team.
